# Next.js TypeScript Starter Kit onchain

![A screenshot of the starter kit](./screenshot.png)

This starter kit is designed to provide a comprehensive template for building frontends for your dApps using Next.js, TypeScript, Shadcn, and Tailwind CSS. It includes setup for WAGMI React hooks and Viem for seamless onchain transactions. 

By default, this template connects to the Morph Sepolia testnet.

## üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Initial Setup

### Environment Configuration

Before you start, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory by running:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

In the file, update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID` variable with your WalletConnect project ID. You can obtain one by registering your project at [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/).

### Install Dependencies 

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn 
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### Running the Development Server

To run the development server, execute one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application in action. Begin by editing `app/page.tsx` to make changes and see them reflected in real time.
