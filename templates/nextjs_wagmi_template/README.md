This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run `cd frontend_examples/nextjs_wagmi_template`

Run `npm install`

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## ABI and Contract

This template comes hardcoded with an ABI and contract address for a simple counter deployed on Morph. You can update these values as needed to connect to your own contracts.
